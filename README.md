### Heaps
### Problem Statement
Implement a method called *outputSorted* which utilizes a **Heap** to sort an array of **Person** objects. An object of
type **Person** is defined as follows:
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    double height;
}
```
The *outputSorted* method expects two arguments; an array of **Person** objects, and a **Comparator**. It will use the
**Comparator** parameter to insert the **Person** objects into a **Heap** in the prescribed order.
### Wrap up
This project went relatively quickly. Considering that I waited until the last minute to get started, I got lucky.
What's really pathetic is that I had extra time to work on this project (two weeks instead of one) and I didn't take
advantage of it. During that time, I *did* move from one city to another, and started a new job, but that was only part 
of the problem. Simply put, I procrastinated. This could have been a real disaster. However, after watching the lecture
twice and doing some supplemental research, I found the assignment fairly intuitive.

### Heaps
### Problem Statement
### Wrap up
This project went relatively quickly. Considering that I waited until the last minute to get started, I got lucky.
What's really pathetic is that I had extra time to work on this project (two weeks instead of one) and I didn't take
advantage of it. During that. I did move from one city to another, and started a new job, but that's only part of the
problem. Simply put, I procrastinated. Primary among those factors averting a disaster was the fact that, after watching
the lecture twice and doing some supplemental research, I felt I had a good grasp of the concepts that were presented.
